				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], as highlighted in the following quotes, the last sentence would be the thesis statement for the reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>a Martian plague</q>, <q>tagalong organisms</q>, <q>harming Earth's biosphere</p>, which discuss throughout the entire essay. 
				In addition, the key phrase in this article is the prevention of harm to Earth's biosphere while space adventure by Law and higher precise room technology.</p>

						<b>Para #2</b> - This paragraph initiates and focuses on <q>It is possible that on Mars there are pathogens...</q><q>extraterrestrial samples contain dangerous tagalong organisms...</q> and <q>The risk of material from other worlds harming Earth's biosphere</q>, explaining the potential risks to Earth's ecology from extraterrestrial creatures.

						<b>Para #1</b> - In the first paragraph of the second section, the author uses the  "have long considered" and " over the approaching decade," opening a new argument. <q>Scientists have long considered Sagan's warnings in mostly hypothetical terms. But over the approaching decade,they will start to act concretely on backward contamination risks.</q>

						<b>Para #2</b> - In the second paragraph, the author uses the sentence "in this case" to extend the argument in paragraph 1 and likes to stress and hint  that it is a very critical subject by "carefully." <q>"Carefully," in this case, means that once the Mars samples drop to Earth,....</q>

						<b>Para #2</b> - In this paragraph, the author links the article retrospectively, attempting to express the dangers that the present Martian samples may pose to humans. However, he did not describe any crisis from those previous events. <q>Materials from around the solar system have come to Earth for study before: moon rocks and dust from American, Soviet and Chinese missions; samples from two asteroids collected by Japanese probes; and particles from solar wind and a comet gathered by spacecraft.</q>

						<b>Para #2</b> - In the third paragraph, the author makes the leading suggestion to treat these samples as high-risk items! Then continue to open the discussion.<q>We have to treat those samples as if they contain hazardous biological materials,....</q>

						<b>Para #3</b> - In this chapter, the author extensively uses pronouns to repeat the arguments' main points; for example, the red planet, another planet representing Mars, in the discussion. Moreover, it replaces the objects brought back from Mars with words such as living things, biological contamination, extraterrestrial material, samples, these materials, etc.

						<b>Para #4</b> - The author uses the contrast between the past equipment capabilities and the current equipment requirements to express the focus of the current efforts.<q>High-containment labs, though, work the opposite way. They maintain negative air pressure, with lower pressure inside their walls than outside. Particles can waft in, but they cannot sneak out.</q>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the article, the author believes that before various construction and significant decisions, it is necessary to communicate with the public and investors rather than conceal risks. The authors also quote from<q> Dr. Hanton's thinks: it has to come from a resident's personal viewpoint. "Not just from the scientist's perspective of learning something new.</q>
				The article's author is finally optimistic about this, saying that if these problems can be solved, then exploring the universe is beautiful and can give us a better understanding of how planets form!<q>
				<p>In the end, the author tries to convince people with a more positive benefit in the last paragraph:<q><span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">It could bring us a small step closer to understanding how, say, a planet produces beings that produce a spacecraft that goes to another world and then brings that world back to this one.</q></p>
