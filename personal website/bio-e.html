				<p>My name is Chun-Heng, Lee. You also can call me Argus by my English nickname. I had well technical training in Electronic Engineering and Industrial Engineering (Bachelor), Management skill - SCM (Master's degree at NTHU), and Material Science Engineering (Doctoral student at NTHU). Thus it caused my plan for academics and career fully to participate and develop in relative industries and areas.</br>
				<p>Based on my experience in my career and my outgoing personality, I always play a team builder who likes to encourage and empower team members. Under this kind of culture, we usually expect to share the feeling of achievement and exaltation on the pass-through to the challenge. Hence, we can always end each task with encouragement, sharing emotions, and being happy with each other's achievements.</p>
				<p>I have been to many countries and learned much about their life and culture with the locals. I am delighted to have such experiences and beautiful memories in my life.</p>
