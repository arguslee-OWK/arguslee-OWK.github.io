			<h5>Lifelong learning </h5>
			
			<section>
				<h2>The purpose of learning</h2>

				<p>Learning is a very natural thing for everyone. People unconsciously learn new things without a specific purpose and motivation to learn and accept knowledge. Then sometimes, we're forced to learn, even intensively; some even cause us to know under the premise of survival, such as being soldiers and police!</p>

				<p>The fields of learning are not limited to language, mathematics, physical chemistry, culture (life, ethics), geography, art, sports, or life skills. Some also include rationalism, psychology, religion, engineering, medicine, law, politics, etc. These fields, for most people, may only be covered in part in a lifetime. Learning includes the explicit function. In addition to learning a new ability immediately, it means allowing yourself to adapt to the unique ability instantly. The inner part comprises character, cultivation, mood, and other factors.</p>

				<h2>The way and effect of learning</h2>

				<p>The faster you learn, the faster it will help you enter various life situations and achieve better survivability! Ignorance and joyful learning are innate until you are intimidated, afraid, or unwilling to learn. Otherwise, you will keep learning and growing, and cause your happiness and motivation will gradually increase.</p>

				<p><q>Adaptation</q> is a significant learning indicator. It can represent that you are not sticking to your experiences and skills in the past, how receptive you are to the arguments and perspectives of a newly learned project!</p>

				<p>Therefore, the beginning of each learning is a significant activity of <q>returning to zero</q> for your existing knowledge, experience, and physical ability. This way, you will be able to accept new skills and capabilities. Otherwise, you will encounter a considerable learning obstacle. Worse, it intends that you won't be able to handle any problems when you face challenges shortly in the future, and you may also get into trouble.</p>

				<h2>Learning about life, thinking, work, characteristics, and interaction with people</h2>

				<p>The necessity of learning is as essential as one's breathing and eating! Positively, it appears literate and easy to get along with people when we handle things, be reasonable, intelligent, and live in groups. Negatively, we can clear up the accumulated unhappiness in our minds and deal with our negative energy.</p>

				<p>When we got the deficiencies, we usually seek improvement through continuous learning in society or cooperation. Our life evolves owing to constant learning! Therefore, we'll have more friends willing to share their lives with us, which eventually leads to a harmonious and happy ending.</p>

				<h2>The need for learning reasons</h2>
			
				<p>It will generate different learning needs with the diversification of our life, such as the needs of work, the influence of society on status, the evolution of social culture, the progress of science and technology, etc. Thus, the need for learning will accompany us throughout our life.</p>

				<p>When we become a parent, we may need to teach the children. And when the children gradually grow up, we must change our role to learn and accompany the children to grow up. That means they are learning something new, and we may need to keep up with their learning and ideas to play our prominent role in the family. As the Chinese saying, <q>One is never too old to learn.</q></p>

				<p>Most modern people will face psychological pressure anytime, and the problems come from various reasons. It may be our ability bottleneck, health problem, interpersonal relationship problem, etc. One day when we are old, the child may gradually leave the original family life circle because of adulthood. Nonetheless, no matter what stage we are at, we will always face different problems, which is why we need constant learning to adjust our minds to a better mental state.</p>

				<h2>Learning how to learn(Self-learning/self-directed learning)</h2>

				<p><q>Learning how to learn</q> is the ultimate solution for lifelong learning. On the one hand, you can get the learning results you want quickly and easily. On the other hand, we can increase our capability without schools and academic units' help all the time.</p>

				<p>Thence, when we are young and still a student, we should try to understand the purpose of learning and start learning and create an effective learning method that is unique to us! This is very useful and crucial for our future life.</p>

				<h2>A word to readers</h2>

				<p>Learning turns out to be a very natural thing. Most people learn many things unconsciously at first. Furthermore, "adaptation" is a significant learning indicator; it can directly explain your mindset and learning results later.</p>

				<p><q>Learning how to learn</q> is the ultimate solution for lifelong learning. Each study is a unique chance to learn, so how to <q>return to zero</q> for our actual knowledge, experience, and physical fitness in mind before entering the class is a significant activity. This kind of activity is quite like swimming, while we must take the chance to inhale every time we surface.</p>

				<p>Learning is to a man what water is to fish, and the Chinese say, <q>One is never too old to learn.</q> During our life journey, many learning needs for skills and positive spiritual growth will expect to overcome the various situations in our future life.</p>
